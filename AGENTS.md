## Project Overview**

**Objective:**
Automatically transform a single natural-language prompt into an executable **multi-agent workflow** using the **OpenAI Agents SDK**.

The system dynamically interprets the userâ€™s intent, designs the appropriate agent roles, defines their relationships, instantiates the agents, and executes the workflow to deliver a structured, re-usable output.
