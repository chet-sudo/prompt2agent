## Project Overview**

**Objective:**
Automatically transform a single natural-language prompt into an executable **multi-agent workflow** using the **OpenAI Agents SDK**.

The system dynamically interprets the user’s intent, designs the appropriate agent roles, defines their relationships (sequence/parallel), instantiates the agents, and executes the workflow to deliver a structured, re-usable output.

---

## Core Principles**

1. **Prompt-driven design** – A single user prompt drives the creation of the entire workflow.
2. **Dynamic agent generation** – Agent roles, tasks, and interdependencies are auto-generated by a meta-agent.
3. **Tool-agnostic foundation** – Tools are optional; agents can operate purely through reasoning or memory.
4. **Reusable workflows** – Generated workflows are exportable as Python scripts or JSON for re-use.
5. **LLM-neutral** – Compatible with any OpenRouter-supported model.
